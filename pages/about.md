**Thanks,** We would like to thank Kate Thornhill and Michele Pflug for their amazing support and excitement to teach us these new skills. Thank you for encouraging us to play around with all the new technology and that it's okay if things don't go right the first time. And thank you to the entire class of LIB 410 for all your feedback and insightful discussions throughout the term that created a safe space for all of us to learn together and helped us grow. And also thank you to Zoom for not working only one time this term, we didn't expect that level of support from you.
