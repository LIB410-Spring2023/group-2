# Collection DMP
## The Oregon Forestry Industry: Equipment and lifestyle of laborers in the 19th and 20th centuries
Our digital collection thematic research topic is focused on the forestry industry in Oregon in the 19th and 20th centuries. We chose this topic because forestry is an important part of Oregonâ€™s history and economy, as the state is still one of the top producers of lumber in the United States today. This collection focuses on the workers who help run this industry, with photographs depicting men at work, maps of worker camp sites, as well as the tools and machinery they used to process and transport lumber. By collecting these digital objects together, we hope that viewers can get a glimpse into the day-to-day lives of loggers and forestry workers in Oregon. To host and give access to this collection we have uploaded our data to CollectionBuilder.

## Data Curation Methodology
To find our data our group looked through GLAMS and gathered objects and metadata that related to forestry in Oregon. In order to ensure data security and preservation, each member of the group had a personal dropbox where they held their objects as well as their own Excel sheet with the metadata for their objects. To make sure all our data was organized and matched with each other we created shared documents in our sharepoint with file naming standards and citation format. All the metadata was organized in a shared Excel sheet before we narrowed down the focus of our topic to workers who help run this industry and the complete metadata for the final objects selected were added to another shared Excel sheet.  We then created a shared google drive folder wtih personal google sheets to put our updated and complete metadata for our objects. Once we checked over each others data to make sure it was all correct and matched we added all of our data to a shared google sheet to be uploaded to github. Our objects were also redownloaded to our computers and put into our dropboxes to have them in multiple places after they were resized to be uploaded to github.

## Roles & Responsibilities
- **Elena Perez,** *Project Manager,* is responsible for overseeing project activities, leading communication, coordinating preparation for various tasks, and more. While in this role they have done a great job of organizing the group and managing our communication. They have also led the group in planning our project and making sure we are staying up to date with due dates and assignment details, and have served as a main point of contact between both Kate and Michelle when questions or uncertainties arise. Given that we do not have a Repository Manager, they have also taken on the main role of finalizing the DMP and data documentation. If Elena were to leave the project, their responsibilities would be allocated amongst other team member until the position is filled. The Collection Development Manager will take on the main role of communication and the Object Preservation Manager would become responsible for managing project related tasks. 

- **Mattie Lucero**, *Collection Development Manager,* is responsible for facilitating the object collection process, selecting the objects we organized in our collection, double-checking copyright and licensing status of all objects, and more. As our CDM, Mattie has helped to develop and organize our inventory lists and helped to coordinate details related to object storage. They have also helped collect objects and narrow our project topic based on the objects we have gathered. They also helped to develop our site homepage and worked with other team members to ensure that all formatting matched MAP standards. If Mattie were to leave the project their various responsibilities would be absorbed by the Object Preservation Manager and the Metadata Manager until the position is filled. 

- **Cecelia Staggs,** *Object Preservation Manager,* has helped to plan and organize the project storage spaces, established file naming standards, and decided on the objects to be included in the collection based on formatting restrictions. In addition, they worked with the Metadata Manager to quality check MAP standards, and then uploaded all objects to the group repository, ensuring that they all appeared on the site with the proper metadata. They also worked to complete the repository readme.md so that interested viewers can understand how to navigate our GitHub and how we developed our site. If Cecelia were leave to the project, their responsibilities would become shared between the Metadata Manager and the Collection Development Manager until the position is filled. 

- **Isabelle Dana,** *Metadata Manager,* has helped to organize our inventory list, decide on the metadata included in our MAP profile, facilitated object cataloging, and carried out metadata quality reviews. They also helped to complete any missing information in our MAP and uploaded all metadata to the group repository. In addition to fulfilling these responsibilities, Isabelle has taken on responsibilities from the Repository Manager role and has taken all meeting notes and recorded any decisions we have made related to the project, as well as helped to troubleshoot issues with CollectionBuilder. If Isabelle were to leave the project, these responsibilities would be allocated between the Project Manager and the Object Preservation Manager.
