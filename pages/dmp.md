# Collection DMP
## The Oregon Forestry Industry: Equipment and lifestyle of laborers in the 19th and 20th centuries
Our digital collection thematic research topic is focused on the forestry industry in Oregon in the 19th and 20th centuries. We chose this topic because forestry is an important part of Oregon’s history and economy, as the state is still one of the top producers of lumber in the United States today. This collection focuses on the workers who help run this industry, with photographs depicting men at work, maps of worker camp sites, as well as the tools and machinery they used to process and transport lumber. By collecting these digital objects together, we hope that viewers can get a glimpse into the day-to-day lives of loggers and forestry workers in Oregon. To host and give access to this collection we have uploaded our data to CollectionBuilder.

## Data Curation Methodology
To find our data our group looked through GLAMS and gathered objects and metadata that related to forestry in Oregon. In order to ensure data security and preservation, each member of the group had a personal dropbox where they held their objects as well as their own Excel sheet with the metadata for their objects. To make sure all our data was organized and matched with each other we created shared documents in our sharepoint with file naming standards and citation format. All the metadata was organized in a shared Excel sheet before we narrowed down the focus of our topic to workers who help run this industry and the complete metadata for the final objects selected were added to another shared Excel sheet.  We then created a shared google drive folder wtih personal google sheets to put our updated and complete metadata for our objects. Once we checked over each others data to make sure it was all correct and matched we added all of our data to a shared google sheet to be uploaded to github. Our objects were also redownloaded to our computers and put into our dropboxes to have them in multiple places after they were resized to be uploaded to github.

## Roles & Responsibilities
- **Elena Perez,** *Project Manager*, is responsible for overseeing project activities, leading communication, coordinating preparation for various tasks, and more. While in this role they have done a great job of organizing the group and managing our communication. They have also led the group in planning our project and making sure we are staying up to date with due dates and assignment details, and have served as a main point of contact between both Kate and Michelle when questions or uncertainties arise. Given that we do not have a Repository Manager, they have also taken on the main role of finalizing the DMP and data documentation. If Elena were to leave the project, their responsibilities would be allocated amongst other team member until the position is filled. The Collection Development Manager will take on the main role of communication and the Object Preservation Manager would become responsible for managing project related tasks. 

- **Mattie Lucero**, *Collection Development Manager*, is responsible for facilitating the object collection process, selecting the objects we organized in our collection, double-checking copyright and licensing status of all objects, and more. As our CDM, Mattie has helped to develop and organize our inventory lists and helped to coordinate details related to object storage. They have also helped collect objects and narrow our project topic based on the objects we have gathered. They also helped to develop our site homepage and worked with other team members to ensure that all formatting matched MAP standards. If Mattie were to leave the project their various responsibilities would be absorbed by the Object Preservation Manager and the Metadata Manager until the position is filled. 

- **Cecelia Staggs,** *Object Preservation Manager*, has helped to plan and organize the project storage spaces, established file naming standards, and decided on the objects to be included in the collection based on formatting restrictions. In addition, they worked with the Metadata Manager to quality check MAP standards, and then uploaded all objects to the group repository, ensuring that they all appeared on the site with the proper metadata. They also worked to complete the repository readme.md so that interested viewers can understand how to navigate our GitHub and how we developed our site. If Cecelia were leave to the project, their responsibilities would become shared between the Metadata Manager and the Collection Development Manager until the position is filled. 

- **Isabelle Dana,** *Metadata Manager*, has helped to organize our inventory list, decide on the metadata included in our MAP profile, facilitated object cataloging, and carried out metadata quality reviews. They also helped to complete any missing information in our MAP and uploaded all metadata to the group repository. In addition to fulfilling these responsibilities, Isabelle has taken on responsibilities from the Repository Manager role and has taken all meeting notes and recorded any decisions we have made related to the project, as well as helped to troubleshoot issues with CollectionBuilder. If Isabelle were to leave the project, these responsibilities would be allocated between the Project Manager and the Object Preservation Manager. 

## Expected Data

### Data Types
There are 24 images (.jpg), 1 text document (.pdf), and 1 audio interview (.mp3) within this digital collection, making up 26 total digital objects.

Here is a breakdown of collection size, work type, file format, total number of assets, average file size, and average total size for a set of file types
| Work Type | File Format | Total Assets | What is the average file size (in MB) for each file type in this collection? | What is the total size of all files (in MB) that have the same file type? |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| image | jpg | 24 | ?? mb | ?? mb |
| text | pdf | 1 | 2.44 mb | 2.44 mb |
| audio | mp3 | 1 | 22.0 mb | 22.0 mb |

In total the collection's data quantity is ?? mb as of June 2023

### Data Handling
Digital objects have been collected from several online repositories by Isabelle Dana, Mattie Lucero, Elena Perez, and Cecelia Staggs. They have ensured that these objects are either in public domain or have copyright licensing that allows for educational use and redistribution. All four group members have applied file naming standardization, file conversions, and resource descriptions to the collected digital objects. All data, including the digital objects and the metadata spreadsheet files, is held in the University of Oregon Dropbox folders of the team members, as well as in a Sharepoint folder. This collection is considered complete at of June 2023 and there is no plan to have additional digital objects added to it in the future.

### File Naming Standard
Filenames should follow the following format: collectorlastname_filetype_briefobjectdescription_serialnumber

Examples: dana_image_bensoncampcrew_001, staggs_image_donkeyengine

collectorlastname: The last name of whoever found the object and is recording it in this digital collection.
filetype: What type of digital object the file is, i.e. image, document (doc), or audio
briefobjectdescription: Briefly explaining what the object is in under twenty characters, in a way that would be clear to someone who is not a part of this project
serialnumber: An optional addition to the end of the file name to describe multiple parts of a series of related files

### Legal and Ethical Restrictions 
We do not foresee any potential issues regarding legal or ethical restrictions. The objects chosen for this project are either in public domain or have copyright licenses that allow for educational use and redistribution with proper credit given. Additionally, all objects are from the 19th and 20th centuries and do not involve modern evolving ethical issues surrounding the logging and forestry industries in Oregon. Many of the objects were donated to the library repositories that the team obtained them from for the purposes of being shared for education, so there is not data that needs to be privatized in this collection.

### Aggregated and Shared Data
All digital objects, including images, documents, and audio files, will be available for download through the team's public CollectionBuilder page. Some of these objects are public domain, while others have certain restrictions around their use and distribution that generally involve giving credit to the repository or creator which currently hold rights over the object. These rights notes have been added to our CollectionBuilder website pages with the objects' metadata so that viewers will know which objects have these restrictions.

## Period of Data Retention
**The data will be available and displayed on our CollectionBuilder site as soon as it is uploaded to our github.**

## Data Formats and Dissemination
The collection consists of files mostly in jpeg format, however, there is also one mp3 file and one pdf document. These file formats have been chosen due to their ability to be downloaded across multiple platforms, user interfaces, and operating systems. Our metadata has been stored as a csv file because it allows us to store our data as plain text, making it easily machine readable and transferrable from our repository to our repository web page. All objects included in our publicly available collection have been reviewed for copyright status and Creative Commons status and are all detailed in the metadata. Most objects are no longer in copyright; however some are either currently in copyright or copyright is still being evaluated. For those where copyright is still being evaluated or are still in copyright, detailed information regarding how to find the original sources, and links to rights statements have been provided to clarify the details of object sharing and legal dissemination of information. The information gathered in this collection has been shared with and managed by the *University of Oregon Digital Scholarship Services*, however, will also be available for anyone in the general public interested in learning about this topic.

## Data Storage and Preservation of Access
Data for this project will be stored in the GitHub repository and accessible through the Collection Builder site. Copies of the data are saved in our team SharePoint and individually in our own Dropbox accounts. The metadata spreadsheet is also available in a group Google Drive folder.

#### About this template 
This data dictionary is intended to support the metadata standardization and object cataloging for the Humanities Research Data Management course. Objects may include images, videos, audio, documents, and other resource types. Each project group should have its method for resource description documented so catalogers can use this MAP for reference while performing resource descriptions. The data standards included in this MAP aligns with CollectionBuilder’s machine-readable requirements for object representation rendering and system functionality. This MAP must align with the [CollectionBuilder’s Data Dictionary](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/metadata/gh_metadata/).
