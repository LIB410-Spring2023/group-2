# LIB 410: Humanities Data Management, Spring 2023
## Course Description
This course provides students with theoretical and practical experience in collecting, processing,
archiving, and publishing humanities data (images, video, sound, text, maps, etc.) gathered from
galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAMs). With the goal of building thematic digital
collections as researchers, students will learn digital methodologies focusing on the technical,
legal, ethical, and social aspects of working with humanities research data throughout its curation
lifecycle. This includes hands-on experience finding, assessing, organizing, and reformatting
data; creating and remediating descriptive metadata; evaluating and determining copyright and
licensing; writing a data management plan using the standards set by the National Endowment
for the Humanities, and sharing thematic research digital collections using GitHub and the open-
source platform CollectionBuilder. (Taken from syllabus)

**The Oregon Forestry Industry:** Equipment and lifestyle of laborers in the 19th and 20th centuries

Our digital collection thematic research topic is focused on the forestry industry in Oregon in the 19th and 20th centuries. We chose this topic because forestry is an important part of Oregonâ€™s history and economy, as the state is still one of the top producers of lumber in the United States today. This collection focuses on the workers who help run this industry, with photographs depicting men at work, maps of worker camp sites, as well as the tools and machinery they used to process and transport lumber. By collecting these digital objects together, we hope that viewers can get a glimpse into the day-to-day lives of loggers and forestry workers in Oregon.

## Data Management Plan

The Data Management Plan (DMP) explains the goal of this project, the roles of participants, what data will be used and how it will be used in the project. It includes the data types and formats, legal and ethical considerations, data location and period of preservation, file naming standard, and a link to the project's metadata application profile

The project's DMP can be viewed [here](https://lib410-spring2023.github.io/group-2/dmp.html).
